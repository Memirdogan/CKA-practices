= TASK2 =
Create a new namespace called cka-task2
Create a new pod `nginx` in the namespace cka-task2 with kubectl.
Create a YAML definition for the pod in task2-pod.yaml.
Update the definition to run the following command. ["/bin/sh","-c", "sed -i 's/listen  .*/listen 8080;/g' /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf && exec nginx -g 'daemon off;'"]
Update the pod definition to expose the container port 8080 with the TCP protocol and name this exposed port http.
Apply the YAML definition. Delete and recreate the pod if necessary.
Expose the running nginx podâ€™s http port with a service named nginx-svc with kubectl. This service should be accessible on port 9000
Write the kubectl command to create the YAML definition for the service you created in the previous step to task2-commands
Run the following command to create a new pod:
kubectl run --image busybox busybox -n cka-task2 -- sleep 100000
Run the following command with the correct values which should return the default nginx page if things are set up correctly.
kubectl exec busybox -n cka-task2 -- wget -O- <SERVICE_NAME>:<SERVICE_PORT> 2> /dev/null
Delete the busybox pod if everything is working as expected:
kubectl delete pod busybox -n cka-task2
